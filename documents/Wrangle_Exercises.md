Ohio Voter Demographics (Context)
---------------------------------

Do American citizens lie when asked if they vote? This question lays at the heart of research examining discrepancies between real voting participation and polled voting participation. From elementary school civics class onwards, it’s hammered into American’s heads that it is their duty as citizens to vote, and yet data shows that for most federal elections barely more than half of the voting age population actually turns out. This number increases when selected down to the registered population, a group who has explicitly said they want to vote, but even then there hasn’t been a presidential election in the modern era in which 80% of the registered voting population voted1. Every election cycle, national spotlight turns to a handful of swing states as predictors of who will win elections, one of these states is Ohio. Ohio’s turnout trends mirror those of the nation pretty closely. According to Ohio’s Secretary of State, in the 2016 presidential election, 71% of registered Ohioans voted; in the 2014 midterms it was 41% (midterms consistently have lower participation than presidential years); in 2012 it was 71% again.

Polls and surveys that attempt to understand the American public’s outlook on issues and political habits, like The Cooperative Congressional Election Survey, rely on the accuracy of participants’ self reporting to make conclusions; if participants lie than the conclusions drawn will reflect inaccurate information. Ph.D candidate Paul Manson at Portland State University suspects that voters consistently claim to vote at a higher rate than they actually do, and that therefore the voter demographics observed by these studies don’t actually reflect the pool of real voters.

Voter participation is the bedrock of American democracy. In order to understand who votes and how, we can look either at estimates derived from samples in studies like The Cooperative Congressional Elections Study (CCES), which rely on self reporting but cover a broad range of topics, or directly looking at voter files, which though completely accurate give us much less information. Demographic information can help predict voting behavior, especially in key swing states like Ohio but this is only true if the representative samples are, in fact, representative. Do people, when asked, over report their voting habits?

Ohio does not collect any demographic information other than age when residents register to vote. Even with this limited information, we can look at whether the age range represented in the CCES accurately reflects the age range of Ohio voters. Who votes in Ohio and who says they vote? Are representative samples of the state actually representative? How reflective are surveys like CCES at all?

There's a lot of data here. Let's start by making information on the year 2012 more managable.

### Exercise 1

The CCES asks over 400 questions, most of which are irrelevant for comparing to the voter file. Narrow the dataset down to just the pertinent information. This should include the weighting of each participant, the state they live in, whether they're registered to vote, the party they're registered with, and whether they voted in the 2012 election.

Select for only the Ohio participants.

Next recode the answers so that the table is more legible - it doesn't matter why someone didn't vote so all of those options can be collated into one answer, no.

You should now have a table that looks like this:

``` r
head(vote12table)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 5
    ##      weight   age registered       party       voted
    ##       <dbl> <dbl>      <chr>       <chr>       <chr>
    ## 1 0.2256249    57        Yes    Democrat         yes
    ## 2 0.2321987    24        Yes  Republican         yes
    ## 3 0.1080216    50        Yes Independent         yes
    ## 4 0.2524297    59        Yes NAorMissing NAorMissing
    ## 5 1.9587926    35        Yes Independent         yes
    ## 6 1.3827350    41        Yes Independent         yes

### Exercise 2

Now, let's do the same thing with the pared down Ohio voter registration file. There's a lot less here, and we only have Ohio voters but we want to narrow it down to just the general election in 2012 and get rid of any superfluous information like the voter's name or address.

You'll also want to create an age variable out of birthdate. For this, make sure you have the lubridate package installed.

Play around with the data, is there anything obviously off with it? How would you explain any irregularities found?

``` r
head(Ohio12table)
```

    ##   age party voted
    ## 1  60  <NA>   yes
    ## 2  66     D   yes
    ## 3  56  <NA>    no
    ## 4  88  <NA>   yes
    ## 5  33  <NA>    no
    ## 6  93     R   yes
